# MissionBay

**MissionBay** is a plugin for the [BASE3 Framework](https://base3.de) that introduces a mission-based agent system to your application. It allows the definition, execution, and orchestration of autonomous agents to perform complex, distributed tasks.

## Features

* ✨ **Mission-Centric Architecture**: Design agents to execute well-defined missions triggered by events, schedules, or data changes.
* 🧰 **Modular Agent Design**: Compose agents from reusable logic blocks and define mission flows.
* ⚖️ **Event-Driven Execution**: Connect agents to signals, webhooks, or internal system events.
* 🌐 **Distributed by Design**: Built to support scale-out scenarios, worker nodes, and remote execution.
* 📈 **Visual & Configurable Flows** *(upcoming)*: Define agent missions through a UI-based flow editor.
* 🔧 **Pluggable Extensions**: Add custom mission types, triggers, conditions, and action handlers.

## Roadmap

* [x] Core agent/missions engine
* [ ] Flow-based visual editor (UI)
* [ ] Remote agents / worker node support
* [ ] Mission debugging & logging tools
* [ ] Role-based access control for mission configuration
